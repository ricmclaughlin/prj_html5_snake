This project is a walk through of the Snake Game chapter of [Udemy's Projects in HTML5](https://www.udemy.com/learn-bootstrap-development-by-building-10-projects/learn/#/). 

This project was supposed to be created using non-tooled starter template but I used the [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp) generator via [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and lots of [Bower]() packages.

The app is a game... the snake game of many years ago on phones prior to all phones being smart. That does not mean this is a "dumb" game but it you might say it is challenged.

The game is implemented as a HTML5 canvas with a good bit of Javascript and jQuery.

This project is part of my [portfolio](http://ric.mclaughlin.today/prj_html5_snake).
